  "body": "## Project goal\r\nThis is the main page of software OCTAnnotate that incorporates several research projects (CADOCT and REVEMOD). This application is an open-source software for computer-aided analysis (segmentation, volumetric mearsurements, visualization) of retinal layers and vitreoretinal pathologies (vitreoretinal traction, VMT and epiretinal membrane, ERM) based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images obtained from Avanti RTvue XR device. This software is written in C++ with Qt libraries.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the software supports manual annotation of 13 retinal layers (PCV, ERM, ILM, NFL/GCL, GCL/IPL, IPL/INL, INL/OPL, OPL/ONL, ELM, Myoid/Ellipsoid, IS/OS, OS/RPE, RPE/Choroid) in OCT images. An image browser/editor is provided as well as an empty SQLite database for OCT scans. The software supports import of automatic retina layers segmentations from OCTExplorer software.\r\n\r\nFor more information please refere to the [User's Guide] (https://github.com/krzyk87/OCTAnnotate/blob/master/Users_guide_v1.0.pdf).\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nPlease note that this project is a \"**work-in-progress**\", meaning many features still needs to be implemented (see issues for the project source code). The automated segmentation of retina layers, vessels and pathologies is not yet implemented. For now this application is used mainly for investigational purposes - visual analysis of retina layers depth based on existing segmentations (such as those provided by OCTExplorer application). Additionaly, for now the software is compatibly only with Avanti RTvue 3D Retina scans. **If you wish to contribute to the project please contact us - your help will be welcome :)**\r\n\r\n### Citing this work\r\nPlease pick one of the following papers:\r\n- M.
