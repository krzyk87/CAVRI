# OCTAnnotate

The main objective of this project is to develop a new method for retina image parameterization as well as an improvement of the existing approaches by combining eye features into one integrated multilevel hierarchical model. The proposed segmentation methods is based on the graph-theory approach and describes the structure of retina layers, stage of selected vitreomacular pathologies (VMT and ERM), structure of blood vessels and other morphological features of the eye.
